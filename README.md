# Unconditional Code Practicing

This is a code snippet to practice not using any sort of explicit branch conditions, such as if statements.

Some strategies to achieve it are by class inheritance, method overload and mapping structures. Unconditional code demands the creation of more methods and better naming, which are good design choices and make the code more understanble. On the other hand, these structures are less perfomatic - at least at the moment of writing of this description - since it's not a widespread concept and compilers are not ready to optimize for it.

This exercise is inspired in [Michael Feather's presentation about Unconditional Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnZ0uTOerUI&ab_channel=GOTOConferences).
